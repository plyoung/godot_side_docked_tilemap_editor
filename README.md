**Install** 

Copy folder in addons to the addons folder in your Godot project's folder.

Note: It makes assumptions about control locations in the editor UI's node tree so might not work in all Godot versions. Tested with:
- 4.2.1

**Features & Use**

It will start working as soon as the addon is enabled in project settings. It basically rips the TileMap editor panel from the bottom dock and place it in a control inside the 2D canvas/scene-view.
